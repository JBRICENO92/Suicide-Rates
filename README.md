# Description
The year 2020 has brought its toll on the majority of people, it has tested our limits to withstand the isolation, loneliness and to overcome depression most of all. However, for some people, the burden was beyond their capabilities and unfortunately they ended their life prematurely. The loss of a loved one, god forbid, is a devastating and a dreadful thing to bear and by all means should be prevented.

Suicide is an extremely complex and sensitive tragedy that causes pain to hundreds of thousands of people every year. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Global Burden of Disease study estimate that almost 800,000 people commit suicide every year. That's roughly two persons per second.

Throughout this challenge, we aim to predict the suicide rate as accurately as possible given the available data.

The data we present here include information related to the causes and annual suicide death rate in each country.

# Project's goal

The main purprose of this project is to predict the number of people who commit suicide according to some indicators in a nation. More precisely, we predict the number of suicides as a rate. Hence, we are aiming to construct , within an open debate, estimators that may help to predict suicide casualties, and that may be used for finding informative variables or causal inference. However, the latter concept is not exploited/discussed in this project and may be considered as an open question.

# Getting started
## Install the requirements

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. You can install the dependencies with the following command-line:

> ```pip install -U -r requirements.txt```

# Test a submission
The submissions need to be located in the submissions folder. For instance for my_submission, it should be located in submissions/my_submission, by default there is already a folder called starting-kit.

To run a specific submission, you can use the ramp-test command line:

> ```ramp-test --submission my_submission```

You can get more information regarding this command line:
