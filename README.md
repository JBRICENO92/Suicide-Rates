# Getting started
## Install

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. You can install the dependencies with the following command-line:

```pip install -U -r requirements.txt```

# Test a submission
The submissions need to be located in the submissions folder. For instance for my_submission, it should be located in submissions/my_submission, by default there is already a folder called starting-kit.

To run a specific submission, you can use the ramp-test command line:

```ramp-test --submission my_submission```

You can get more information regarding this command line:
